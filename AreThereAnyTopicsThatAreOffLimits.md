# Are there any topics that are off limits?
## What I'm asking
This question sends a signal. It's meant to tell someone that I'm aware we're wading into difficult territory, that some of the things we could talk about are private or fraught. I want them to know that we can avoid those topics, that there's nothing we need to talk about that's as important to me as their own comfort and safety. 

## Who to ask
This question is increasingly becoming a standard element in user interview scripts. Subject areas that can seem innocuous can be triggering for people in the thick of them. (For example, I've interviewed social workers about the licensing process, and was not prepared for the level of frustration around the expense of the process.) 

## What to expect

## When to ask
For user interviews, ask this question toward the beginning, after you've outlined what subject area you intend to cover. Tell them what you'd like to talk about, then acknowledge that the subject could include difficult or sensitive topics. Ask them if there are any topics that you should stay away from. More often than not -- perhaps reflecting every human's desire to be helpful -- they will tell you they're an open book. Express your thanks, but remind them that they can put a stop to any line of questioning.
