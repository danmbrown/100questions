# Are there any topics that are off limits?

## What I'm asking
This question sends a signal. It's meant to tell someone that I'm aware we're wading into difficult territory, that some of the things we could talk about are private or fraught. I want them to know that we can avoid those topics, that there's nothing we need to talk about that's as important to me as their own comfort and safety. 

## Who to ask
This question is increasingly becoming a standard element in user interview scripts. While at one point, I might have asked people only when the domain itself was known to be sensitive or difficult. But it turns out that subject areas that can seem innocuous can be triggering for people in the thick of them. For example, I've interviewed social workers about the licensing process, and was not prepared for the level of anxiety around the expense of the process.

## What to expect
For better or worse, when I ask this question people generally tell me that nothing is off-limits. To be clear, I ask this question after outline the scope of our conversation. In the rare occasion you do get a response, reflect those topics back to the person to show that you heard them. Do what you have to do to keep those topics front and center. Admit that you might make a mistake, but invite them to correct you. Most importantly, adopt the mindset that regardless of how the respondent has constrained you, you can learn a lot from this person.

## When to ask
For user interviews, ask this question toward the beginning, after you've outlined what subject area you intend to cover. Tell them what you'd like to talk about, then acknowledge that the subject could include difficult or sensitive topics. Ask them if there are any topics that you should stay away from. More often than not -- perhaps reflecting every human's desire to be helpful -- they will tell you they're an open book. Express your thanks, but remind them that they can put a stop to any line of questioning.

## What to ask next
Never ask for an explanation of why a topic might be off-limits. To do so would be to already betray the participant. Instead, the next thing to say, regardless of how they responded, is to reassure them that if the conversation strays into topics that make them uncomfortable, they can ask you to move along. Remind them that even if they didn't name a particular topic, they are not compelled to talk about anything they don't feel like talking about.

## Other ways to ask

### Offer options

> We're going to cover the following topics. Take a look at the list and let me know if there are any I should avoid?

The intent here isn't to constrain the possible responses but instead provide further insight into what you intend to cover. Beyond clarifying the agenda, revealing the various topics makes it easier for the participant to establish boundaries. Showing a list of topics lowers the cognitive burden, I think, to naming things that should be off-limits.


### Change the tone

> This is a difficult topic. Where would you like to start?

Instead of inviting someone to name areas of the topic that might be difficult for them, you instead ask them to direct the conversation. Like inviting them to tell you what's off-limits, asking them where to start empowers them, still signaling that you're here to learn from them.
