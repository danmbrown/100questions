# Do you know what your priorities are?

## What I'm asking
Everyone has priorities, and a large part of design work entails determining or defining priorities. Whether we're weighing features or business goals or types of content or user needs, you can't successfully design anything if everything is the same level of importance. For the most part, however, I ask this question to understand what a person on my team thinks they need to be working on. In this case, "priorities" refers to their tasks and activities.

## Who to ask
This question is almost always directed to someone on my team, someone who is responsible for doing work on a project. Generally, I'm responsible for ensuring they have tasks to do, and that they know what those tasks are. While I can tell them what their priorities are, asking them to say their priorities out loud allows me to confirm that they've internalized them the best they can. They're also making sort of a social contract, a commitment to working on something, one that is perhaps stronger than simply saying "yes, I understand what my priorities are."

You can ask anyone about their priorities, about what's important to them with respect to their time or this project. But arriving at _strategic_ priorities is different from defining a person's tactical priorities. That is, if I were curious about a stakeholder's priorities relative to a project  I'm not sure asking them directly is the best way at getting at them. Perhaps more nuanced: I can ask about someone's priorities, but often what someone says is important to them strategically is not what's actually important to them.

## What to expect
They'll tell you what they're supposed to be working on. Perhaps they'll list some specific tasks or outline the scope of what they're supposed to think about. You're listening to make sure that what they think they should be doing is actually what they should be doing. By saying it out loud, they give you a sense of whether they understand the scope and intent, giving you a chance to course-correct.

Sometimes, they cast their net too wide, thinking they need to do more than they're supposed to, and you now have a chance to further prioritize. To do this I like characterizing some of their tasks as "must do" and "stretch goals."

Other times, when they say it out loud you realize that the scale is too large or too small given the time allotted. This is another good reason to ask them to
