# What aspects of this will your stakeholders be most interested in or concerned about?

## What I'm asking
As design professionals, we point our effort in the direction of the user. Everything we do, we do in the hopes of making someone's life a little easier. But not everyone involved with the project thinks this way. Although I'm usually working with people who, like me, want to serve the needs of the folks using the product, those people report to stakeholders who rely on a different north star. (I might argue that the emergent tension in the direction for the design is good for the process, but that's a tale for another book.) With this question, I'm opening the door to talking about stakeholder management. Producing a good product is more than just coming up with a good design: it's ensuring that the people who affect movement toward an outcome build momentum and not inertia. 

## Who to ask
In my world, as a design consultant, I usually have one person who is accountable for the outcome of the project -- perhaps a product manager or product owner. They've brought me in to build the team's capacity and skillset to produce a good product. I understand that on paper that's my role. But in practice, my role entails helping the product owner keep the project on track -- minimizing disruptions by ensuring everyone has a voice in the process, everyone feels heard, and everyone understands the direction we're going. This is the person I ask, the one who is ultimately responsible for not just producing the the product, but delivering on the promised outcomes. They're the ones with stakeholders who are most likely to intervene. At best these stakeholders are concerned about the same things the rest of the team is. Their interventions are disruptive but welcome because they inject useful perspectives. At worst, stakeholders come with a raft of concerns unrelated to the core problem. Best to know about both of these as early as possible so that I, as a contributor and perhaps leader on the project, can support the product owner as they manage these interventions.

## What to expect
In some cases the product owner maintains a rosy view of their stakeholders, assuming they have the same concerns as the rest of the team. Do not take their assertion at face value: The proof is in the pudding. Product owners who are even a little jaded understand that every stakeholder has buttons that need pushing. Perhaps they'll tell you that a certain turn of phrase needs to be part of the strategy, or that every decision must be supported with quantitative data. A good product owner knows what their stakeholders respond to positively -- and what might turn a minor intervention into a major disruption. 

You're looking for insights on what details about the project the stakeholder will pay closest attention to. Perhaps they've had personal challenges with certain features on other sites -- search or check-out, for example -- and this looms large in their imagination as they look at your project. You're also interested in learning about their potential hang-ups in terms of process or approach. They might have had bad experiences with user research or information architecture in the past.
