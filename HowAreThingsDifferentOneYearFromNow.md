# How are things different one year from now?

## What I'm asking
Put simply, I want to know what changes have happened between now and some imaginable time in the future. A year from now is sufficiently long to make a change, but not so far into the future to be put off by the abstraction of it. I'm asking that for the level of energy and effort this person intends to expend over the coming twelve months, what do they expect to see out of the other side of it? In some ways, I'm asking how they define success.

Depending on the circumstance and my relationship to the person, I'm asking about what role they expect me to play in that change. This question signals, "You have my attention, you have my participation, what do you expect to be different with me here?"

## Who to ask
This question works on a number of levels for a variety of circumstances. I can ask a project stakeholder about what changes they expect on their project over the course of a year. I can ask a mentee what they expect to get out of our coaching arrangement.

### Change the tone
If I'm talking to someone named Cass about their career growth and it's January 2022, I might frame the question like this:

> How is January 2023 Cass different from January 2022 Cass?



### Narrow the scope
> ALTERNATE
