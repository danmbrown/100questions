# What do you expect to see come out of the other end of this process?

## What I'm asking
When a process comes to an end, we can usually expect an outcome -- a way in which the world is a little bit different. In design we're sometimes more focused on the process itself -- all the things we do -- and not the outcome -- the changes we experience. Asking this question encourages us to pay attention to those outcomes. Moreover, it encourages people to make their expectations plain. It addresses the common challenge that stakeholders in the design process make assumptions about what the design process will accomplish. It compels the team to talk through the potential inconsistent expectations about the conclusions of design.

One aspect of this question that makes it powerful is that it treats the process itself as a black box. This isn't to say that the design process should be a black box, but for the sake of talking about outcomes, we're ignoring the details about the activities to get there. One reason why that's important is that there are several ways to get to the same outcomes. Knowing the expectations allows the design team to make course corrections without giving up the overall objective.

## Who to ask
As someone in client services, I ask this question of every client. I ask it of every person on the client's team. I'll go around the table and ask each person to say what they expect. There's value in everyone sharing so that we can re-set and normalize the expected outcomes of the design process. In some ways, nothing is more important than everyone knowing what we're aiming for.

But even outside the context of client services this question can help any design or product team gauge the expectations of their stakeholders. Like any other complex process in this world, the design process is not widely understood, and comes fraught with preconceptions.

## What to expect
I'm listening for a few things when I ask this question.

First, I want to know what deliverables or artifacts they expect to have in-hand at the end of this process. A set of high-fidelity mock-ups of every screen is different from a few architecture diagrams to describe the structure of the product.
