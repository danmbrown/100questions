Questions are essential to design. I mean that literally: they are the essence of design. In my more passionate moments, I'd say that asking questions and doing design are indistinguishable, the latter merely a subset of the other. Engaging in the design process yields, at its conclusion, a product -- something that people use and hopefully find some value.

Since the dawn of the practice of design, designers have sought to define the process. It's helpful to explain to those around you --  who might also be participating the design process -- what it entails. It's useful for planning, to know what steps you'll take. It's a surefire way to reproduce earlier success, to repeat the process. And to explain it, to plan it, or to repeat it, you have to know what the process is. 

But it's the lack of definition, the absence of a clear set of steps, that makes design so versatile. It solves problems not because it makes use of rote procedures. It solves problems because it is an approach that can be adapted to many situations.

By approach I mean a collection of tools and techniques. But also a mindset: a frame of mind that drives designers to look at the world afresh, to engage in experimentation, and to listen to a wide range of perspectives. I've previously encapulated this mindset as comnbining curiousity, skepticism, and humility. 

At the heart of this approach, at the intersection of these three aspects of the mindset, is the question. And that is why I say design is indistinguishable from questions.

Earlier I said that the design process yields, at its conclusion a product of value and utility. Designers of all stripes will see the fallacy of that statement. Design never really has a conclusion. Instead, it's more a convenient (or inconvenient) place to stop. What goes into a product is a series of decisions: a collection of assertions about how the product looks and behaves. Those decisions didn't come from the ether. They came from deliberation.
